                As a software engineering student, I was part of a team developing a new web application for a
                construction company. As the lead business analyst, I was responsible for overseeing the development of
                the app and ensuring it was in accordance with the client's requirements. Early on in the project, I
                scheduled regular meetings with software engineers and our team. I documented the key points discussed
                in each meeting so everyone remained up to date on any feedback or changes made. As the project
                progressed, I made a conscious effort to communicate regularly with other stakeholders from the company
                , including the project manager, who was responsible for ensuring the app met the needs of the company's
                customers, as well as the UI/UX designers, who were responsible for designing the look of the app.
                Ultimately, the project was a success, and the app was well-received by the project manager and
                engineers. I believe that my ability to communicate effectively with both engineers and stakeholders
                played a significant role in the project's success.

                As a software engineering student, I was involved in the development of a new mobile app for improving
                commuter’s user experience. As part of the team, I collaborated in brainstorming sessions for the apps
                design and functionality. During this stage, I actively participated in idea generation and made sure
                to
                consider the ideas and concerns of other team members when making decisions. I would often share
                interesting articles, research papers and tutorials with the team, sparking discussion and further
                brainstorming about new and creative ideas for the project. Moreover, I proactively conducted user
                research prior to the development of any ideas or project to understand commuters current user

                During my internship, I was working on several projects which required working with databases
                containing
                enormous datasets. During each of these projects, I was responsible for querying datasets to extract
                certain information from them that was relevant to the specific project. In one instance, I had to
                extract the most importance KPI’s for the company’s products. Since many KPI’s were spread across
                different datasets, I had to create a detailed query to merge them all correctly into one succinct
                table. In order to use the information in visualisations I had to make requests to the server, clean
                the
                data and allocate it to the appropriate graph. Ultimately, the project was praised for summarising all
                the data requirements for each project and provided valuable insights to business operations.

                During the internship, I was required to be very self-sufficient when completing projects or tasks
                provided by my supervisor. From the beginning, my supervisor was preoccupied with a major data
                migration
                project which meant I had to manage my progress, deadlines and performance most of the time. Early on
                in
                the internship, I realised I had to organise my projects according to their priority and time. I
                documented them on a simple excel spreadsheet and shared it with my supervisor. I organised weekly
                meetings with my supervisor and presented PowerPoint slides on the progress of each project or
                completion of a task. Any problems, queries or setbacks were also addressed in this meeting with my
                supervisor. Ultimately, sharing the progress of each project and task, scheduling and preparing
                regular

                As a software engineering student, I was part of team to develop a new e-commerce platform for a local
                retailer. Throughout the project, I made a conscious effort to work collaboratively with my teammates,
                engage in weekly meetings, answer queries and solutions to coding problems. I would actively seek out
                feedback from other team members of the team, making sure to consider their ideas and concerns when
                making decisions. Early on in the project, I also found myself taking on a more leadership role. I
                realised after the initial meetings, information communicated during each meeting was either forgotten
                or misunderstood. From then on, I took the initiative to document important information from each
                meeting, so everyone remained up to date. Ultimately, our e-commerce platform was a success, and we
                received high marks for our work. I believe my ability to work collaboratively with my teammates and
                take on a leadership role when required was instrumental to our success.

            <p>During my internship, I was asked by my supervisor to dispose of devices such as laptops and desktops
              because they were written off and replaced with newer models. Before doing so, I was responsible for
              retrieving hardware components from these old devices. I was perplexed by the request because I thought
              these would not be useful in the newer models. However, I was assured by my supervisor this was not the
              case and that most parts such as the batteries, fans, RAM, SSD and Hard Drive were reused in other
              computers. I was surprised by the fact and very excited to get a move on with removing the parts.
            </p>
            <p> After removing all the parts from the computers, I had to discern which parts were reusable or damaged.
              For example, many of the batteries removed were not reusable and instead I disposed of them in a separate
              recycling bin for hazardous materials. I was glad my supervisor encouraged me to remove these parts so
              they could be recycled properly. Parts that were reusable were used during my internship for speedy
              replacements for employees’ broken computers. I felt pleased when I reused parts, and they functioned
              properly on a different computer.
            </p>
            <p> I found this an eye-opening experience because I assumed a company working in electronics, wouldn’t
              think twice about recycling old hardware components. But it was impressive to see even such companies make
              small steps to be more sustainable with their resources. Dowling et al (2016) reinforce similar strategies
              of conserving resources and limiting emissions as vital for sustainable engineering. Upon reflection, this
              experience has highlighted the benefits of recycling parts are three-fold. First and foremost, it saves
              money. Secondly, enables quick repairs rather than waiting for new parts to arrive. And finally, it
              reduces waste and resource consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience has taught me the value of recycling hardware parts which I will strive to do going
              forward as a software engineer. I have a newfound respect for old hardware components and look forward to
              opportunities to recycle and reuse again.

              </h5>
              <p>The company I was interning at, Legrand, is a global company with headquarters in France. Throughout my
                internship, I had several instances where I was engaged in conversation with employees from different
                cultures than my own, predominately French. During the initial stages of my internship, I was given a
                project to extrapolate data from their databases and create user-friendly data visualisations so that
                the
                method engineers could easily and quickly understand their performance KPIs. This task required me to
                maintain constant communication with several engineers who were French.
              </p>
              <p>During an initial meeting with the engineers, I was asked “what do you mean by this?” or repeated
                myself several times. I noticed within myself that my communication of ideas was not being well received
                and
                not completely understood by the other employees. After some time, I started to slow down my speaking,
                because I realised for these engineers, English was their second language, and I was making it hard for
                them
                to keep up with what I was saying. I tried to use simpler terms to minimise misunderstandings which were
                well-received. I also was surprised at times by their different communication style which was more
                direct
                and straight to the point. I was used to casual and indirect communication which I had with my IT team,
                who
                were from the same culture as me. After the meeting, I felt slightly overwhelmed by the experience since
                I
                was not used to such conversation styles.</p>
              <p>Upon reflection, I noticed that not only did I lack experience, but also intercultural competence to
                communicate with engineers from a different culture than my own. In my culture, I have always grown up
                to
                engage in more casual conversation, less direct and which can be humorous at times. Since the IT
                department
                in which I worked in was predominately Australian, I found conversation easier because we understood
                each
                other’s communication approach. I had to develop the skills to effectively communicate and collaborate
                with
                people and I struggled to do that at the time.</p>
              <p>In retrospect, I have never realised that my own cultural biases and assumptions hindered my worldview.
                Looking back, I realise how important it is to include relevant constructs from other cultural
                worldviews
                by
                being more aware of different communication styles, values and norms (Bennet, 2004). Bennet (2004)
                article
                reinforces that acting in ways that to some extent appropriate in other cultures helps improve
                intercultural
                competence. I am now more aware of my own cultural biases and assumptions and will continue to practice
                intercultural competence to enhance communication and collaboration in a global and intercultural
                workplace.
